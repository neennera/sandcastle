# Svelt Doc

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Developing

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## prettier
```bash
npx prettier --write src/**/*.svelte
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm start // to test
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
